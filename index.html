                    <p> Hello and welcome to my portfolio page! My name is Kathy Kang. I'm currently enrolled in Georgia Tech's Coding Bootcamp in hopes of becoming a web developer. I've always had an interest in computers and technology, but never thought of pursuing it as a career until recently. I'm currently working as an office manager in a small appliance repair company. I enjoy playing video games (on PC), spending time with friends and family, and playing with my pets in my free time. I also love watching horror movies! </p>
